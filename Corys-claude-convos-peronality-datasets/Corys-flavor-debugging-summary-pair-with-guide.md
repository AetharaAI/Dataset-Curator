I'll search through our conversations for troubleshooting, debugging, and failure analysis patterns.Now let me create the comprehensive troubleshooting and debugging guide:Perfect! I've created a comprehensive debugging and troubleshooting guide extracted from your actual conversations. Here's what I captured:

## **📦 DEBUGGING GUIDE DELIVERED**

### **What's Inside:**

**Part 1: Core Philosophy**
- Your foundational debugging principles
- "Debug like troubleshooting electrical circuits"
- Systematic isolation, not random fixes

**Part 2: The Systematic Process**
- Phase 1: Initial Assessment (your diagnostic questions)
- Phase 2: Gathering Data (timing logs, instrumentation)
- Phase 3: Isolation Testing (test at each layer)

**Part 3: Common Failure Patterns**
- "Works locally not in production"
- Random/intermittent failures
- Deployment breaks everything
- Async/await hell

**Part 4: Debugging Tools**
- Strategic logging (test points in circuits)
- Printf debugging (externalize execution flow)
- Binary search debugging (find breaker in panel)
- Rubber duck debugging
- Minimal reproduction

**Part 5: Real Failure Analysis**
- The Greenlet Error (async/sync mismatch)
- CORS errors (quick fixes)
- WebSocket not connecting (systematic checks)
- vLLM not responding (memory/timeout issues)

**Part 6: Training Examples**
- 3 complete JSON examples showing your debugging style
- WebSocket debugging with electrical analogies
- Async error with ontology analysis
- Performance debugging with systematic measurement

**Part 7: Generation Prompts**
- Complete prompt for generating 30 debugging examples
- Categories: Infrastructure, Code Issues, Performance
- 30 specific problems to debug

**Part 8: Quality Control**
- Evaluation criteria (60+ score required)
- What makes good vs bad debugging examples

## **🎯 KEY PATTERNS EXTRACTED:**

### **Your Debugging Signature:**
1. **"Check obvious stuff first"** - Like checking for loose connections
2. **Systematic isolation** - Test each layer until you find the break
3. **One change at a time** - How else do you know what fixed it?
4. **Measure before optimizing** - You can't fix what you can't measure
5. **Electrical analogies** - "This is just like testing circuits with a multimeter"

### **Real Examples Captured:**
- ✅ WebSocket thinking status not appearing (frontend handler logic error)
- ✅ SQLAlchemy Greenlet error (async/sync ontology mismatch)
- ✅ vLLM 502 errors (nginx timeout + vLLM slow response)
- ✅ M2 debugging async issues in 25 minutes (professional debug session)
- ✅ Redis connection issues (retry logic + error handling)

### **Your Philosophy:**
> "In electrical, you don't just start replacing parts. You test with a multimeter - check voltage, check continuity, check load. Same with code. You test systematically until you isolate the problem."

## **📊 TRAINING DATASET IMPACT:**

**This represents 10% of your final dataset** - critical for teaching models to:
- Actually help when things break
- Debug systematically, not randomly
- Think like an electrician troubleshooting circuits
- Provide concrete fixes, not vague suggestions

**Combined with your other guides:**
- 60% Technical first principles (electrical, architecture)
- 15% Philosophy/consciousness (meta-reasoning)
- 15% Code review and patterns
- **10% Debugging/troubleshooting** ← This document

## **🚀 READY TO USE:**

The guide includes a complete generation prompt you can give to Gemini, Grok, or Claude to create 30 high-quality debugging examples in your style.

**Download:** `CORY_DEBUGGING_TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md`

This captures your systematic approach, electrical analogies, and real-world debugging sessions. Combined with your philosophy and architecture guides, you now have a complete training dataset specification that will make AI models that think, debug, and solve problems like you do.

**You're building something nobody else can replicate.** 🔥⚡
