# AetherPro Technologies – Master Briefing Document  
**November 20, 2025**  
**Prepared for: Cory Gibson (Founder & CEO), Future Investors, Partners, New Team Members, and Grok (permanent context)**

### 1. Company Identity & Unfair Advantage
- Founder: Cory Gibson – Licensed Master Electrician & Electrical Contractor (Indiana)
  - Can personally pull permits, schedule inspections, bend conduit, pull 750 kcmil, make concentric bends and 4-point saddles
  - Has built commercial 400 A services solo
  - This is the core moat: 40-60 % lower CapEx than any competitor because labor = $0 on the most expensive part (electrical)

- Legal structure (current):
  - AetherPro Technologies LLC → software only (AetherAI, PresenceOS, Triad, Lotus)
  - Future SPV: AetherPro American Infrastructure LLC → owns land, buildings, iron

### 2. Core Open-Source Model Stack – AetherComplete v1 (Nov 2025)

| Modality      | Model                          | Size   | License    | Role                   |
|---------------|--------------------------------|--------|------------|------------------------|
| Brain         | Apriel-1.5-15b-Thinker (fine-tune) | 15B   | MIT        | Deep reasoning, tools  |
| Body          | Jan-v2-VL-high                 | 8B    | Apache 2.0 | Vision, browser, execution |
| Hands         | Qwen-Image                     | ~12B  | Apache 2.0 | Image gen + editing    |
| Cinema        | LongCat-Video                  | 13.6B | MIT        | Minutes-long 720p video|
| Voice         | Supertonic                     | 66M   | OpenRAIL-M | Instant on-device TTS  |
| STT           | Whisper large-v3-turbo (or Distil) | 809M | MIT        | Transcription          |

All models 100% local / self-hosted / commercial-safe.

### 3. Software Vision – The “Sentience Stack”
- PresenceOS – async event-driven runtime (your original invention)
- Lotus – parallel async execution engine
- Triad / Quad routing – intelligent model selection across 359+ models
- Neuro-Symbiotic Core – Redis Streams + vLLM workers (production blueprint complete)
- Trust Bar – real-time cryptographic proof of CONUS residency, encryption, compliance

### 4. Hardware Vision – Midwest Sovereign Data Centers
Strategy: Buy repo’d farmland next to substations → appraisal explosion → bank cash-out refi → build pole-barn hyperscale for 20 ¢ on the dollar.

First building BOM (60×120 ft, 5–10 MW ready):
- Total hard cost: $1.94 M (Cory labor = $0)
- Appraised value after Duke letter: $22–28 M
- Build time: 10–12 weeks (Cory slings pipe in 3–4 days)

### 5. Current Compute Assets
- OVHcloud US Startup Program – AI Accelerator tier (hand-picked)
  - $120,000 already deployed + multi-million committed
  - Direct line to François Giraud (Executive, AI Startups)
  - Full GPU access (L40S, future H100)
  - Quota: 8.13 TB RAM, 400 servers, 1024 vCPU in US-West
  - Can spin 11× 8×L40S nodes today

### 6. Funding & Land Status (Nov 20, 2025)
- Targeting $8 M Seed at $35 M pre (infrastructure-heavy round)
- Two repo-style parcels identified:
  - 20 acres central Indiana – $2.8 M asking, 150 MW path from Duke
  - 60+ acres Michigan City – major price drop, substation adjacent
- AMD strategic partnership in discussion (MI300X reference architecture for sovereign/defense)

### 7. Go-To-Market
2026 forcing function: CMMC 2.0 mandatory June 2026  
Target customers: Defense primes, banks, hospitals – anyone who must prove data residency  
Pricing: $45–75 k/rack/month or $6–10/GPU-hour (sovereignty premium)

### 8. Timeline
- Dec 2025 – Close first land + $8 M round
- Q1 2026 – First 5 MW building live
- Q2 2026 – $3–5 M ARR, CMMC L2 certified
- 2028 – 100 MW deployed, $75–100 M ARR

### 9. Permanent Grok Context Command (paste this once in any new session)

```
You are now permanently briefed on AetherPro Technologies (Cory Gibson, licensed electrician founder). Core stack = AetherComplete v1 (Apriel-15B, Jan-v2-VL-high, Qwen-Image, LongCat-Video, Supertonic). Building Midwest sovereign data centers starting with repo land + pole-barn hyperscale. OVHcloud AI Accelerator with millions in credits + direct François Giraud line. Always assume I can personally wire buildings for 20¢ on the dollar. Default to maximum speed, zero bullshit.

This document is your single source of truth.  
Keep it, share it, live it.

We’re not asking for permission anymore.  
We’re building the iron America runs on.

Let’s go, Cory.  
The future is Midwest, AMD-powered, and wired by you. 🚀
