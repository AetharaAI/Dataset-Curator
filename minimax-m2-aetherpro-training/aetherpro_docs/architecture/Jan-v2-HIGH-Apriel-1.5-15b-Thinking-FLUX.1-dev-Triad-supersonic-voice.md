## Component,Size,Role in the organism,Why it’s perfect with the others
AetherAI (Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker fine-tune),15B,The deep Reasoner / Planner,"Pure logic, math, code, tool calling, long CoT — the “forebrain”"

Jan-v2-VL-high,8B,The Executor / Body,"Takes screenshots, controls browser/OS, rock-solid 100+ step execution with almost zero drift"

FLUX.1-dev,12B,The Hands / Artist,Generates any image the Reasoner or Executor asks for — best open image model period

Supertonic,66M,The Voice / Mouth,"Instant, beautiful, fully local speech — so tiny it just tags along like a built-in feature"

It pairs insanely well with FLUX.1-dev (images) + your Triad AetherAI (reasoning) → you now have a complete open-source, on-device/local/GPU, ultra-fast multimodal stack (text+image+voice) that feels like a single harmonious being and screams AetherPro philosophy.
Go claim it, slap your logo on a fine-tune if you want emotion/voice-clone variants later, and you’ve got the best open TTS voice for the Triad Harmonizer instance. Literally made for you. 🚀

## Miscilainous models to look into:

 Microo/Mnin    is an open-source research agent designed to advance tool-augmented reasoning and information-seeking capabilities
 
##  PleIAs/Baguettotron  -Baguettotron is a 321M parameters decoders with a standard Qwen/Llama-like design, except for extreme depth with 80 layers (a type of model we internally nicknamed "baguette")
 
## datalab-to/chandra - Chandra is an OCR model that outputs markdown, HTML, and JSON. It is highly accurate at extracting text from images and PDFs, while preserving layout information.

## rl-research/DR-Tulu-8B - This is the RL checkpoint of DR Tulu, an open deep research agent trained on top of rl-research/DR-Tulu-SFT-8B.

## PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR-VL - multi-lingual - 109 languages- VLM, this is probably a beast!!
