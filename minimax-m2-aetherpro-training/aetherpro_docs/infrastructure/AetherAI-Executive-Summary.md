# AetherAI Sovereign Compute - Executive Summary

## The Problem

Every defense contractor, bank, and hospital running AI in 2026 faces the same question: "Where can I run AI and PROVE the data never left U.S. soil?" Today, the answer is nowhere. June 2026 brings mandatory CMMC 2.0 Level 2 compliance for all federal contractors. $43 billion in AI contracts are already awarded. Average penalty for sovereignty violation: $2.3 million. Every contractor needs verifiable CONUS compute or they lose the contract.

## The Solution

AetherAI is American-owned Midwest data centers delivering cryptographically-proven sovereign compute. We don't compete with OpenAI on models—we compete with Equinix and AWS GovCloud on provable infrastructure, and we win on both proof and economics.

**Our Stack:**
- 100% CONUS facilities, AMD-powered, built by a licensed electrician who knows the actual cost of 4" rigid conduit
- Real-time cryptographic Trust Bar (not a compliance badge—cryptographic proof that updates every 2 seconds)
- Triad routing across self-hosted on-prem models with zero vendor lock-in
- CMMC L2 → FedRAMP → IL5 compliance roadmap

## The Unfair Advantage

I'm not guessing CapEx—I'm living it. I buy repo'd farmland next to Duke Energy substations for $100-150k/acre, secure 100 MW power commitment, refinance at $1-2M/acre appraisal, then personally pull the wire and terminate the lugs. Industry quotes $8-12M per 5 MW building. My all-in cost: $1.94M. I build hyperscale data centers for 20¢ on the dollar because I turn the screws myself.

**First Building BOM:**
- 60' × 120' pole-barn hyperscale construction
- 8× NVIDIA L40S GPUs (MI300X upgrade path)
- Turnkey cost: $1.94M (my labor = $0)
- Appraised value day Duke signs: $25M+

This isn't spreadsheet CapEx. This is conduit schedule and one-line diagrams.

## Traction

- $120k OVHcloud US credits deployed (multi-million commitment)
- 3 Zoom calls with François Giraud, OVH Startup Program Lead
- First 5 MW building site under contract (December close)
- Letters of intent from two defense contractors waiting on facility completion

## Market

$43B federal AI spend in 2024. $200B+ total addressable market for sovereign compute by 2028. CoreWeave raised $12 billion on rented GPUs. We own the iron in the Midwest at 10× lower CapEx.

**Business Model:**
- Rack lease: $45-75k/month
- GPU-hour: $6-10/hr (sovereignty premium)
- Gross margin: 70-85% after power
- Path to $25M ARR in 24 months with three buildings

## The Ask

**$8M seed round at $35M pre-money valuation (22.8% ownership)**

**Use of Funds:**
- $4M: First two 5 MW buildings (land + steel + GPUs)
- $2M: CMMC/FedRAMP audit + core team
- $2M: Working capital + second facility

## Vision

- **2026:** Default sovereign compute layer for American AI
- **2028:** 100 MW deployed across Midwest facilities  
- **2030:** The Equinix of sovereign AI infrastructure

One electrician from Indiana is making sure America keeps the lead.
