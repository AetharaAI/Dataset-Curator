Perfect! Here's the cleaned-up, corrected version ready to drop straight into Slide 25:

## SLIDE 25: THE TEAM

**Visual Direction:**
- Founder-focused (since it's currently a solo operation)
- Professional headshot on left
- Clean, credible, technical background emphasis
- Future team roles outlined on right

The Team: Built by Someone Who Thinks Different

**Content:**

**FOUNDER SPOTLIGHT (large section, left 60%):**

**CORY GIBSON**
Founder & CEO

**Photo:** [Professional headshot]

**Background:**
- **Licensed Electrical Contractor** (Nashville, Indiana - 2024)
- **15+ years** as Master Electrician
- **Former Service Department Supervisor & Project Manager**
- Designed and delivered critical power systems that never fail
- Ran multimillion-dollar infrastructure projects from permits to completion

**The Technical Foundation:**
"I'm not a traditional tech founder—I'm an electrician who thinks in power grids. I built AetherAI the same way I built electrical distribution systems: distributed, fault-tolerant, load-balanced. When you hold both a Master Electrician license AND an Electrical Contractor license, you learn one thing: systems that support critical operations can't have single points of failure. That's why Lotus and Triad work the way they do."

**Self-Taught in LLMs:**
Discovered LLMs in April 2024. By May, founded AetherPro. By December, built a DoD-ready platform from scratch—applying the same first-principles thinking and compliance rigor I learned pulling permits and passing inspections.

**Why This Matters:**
Most AI startups are built by ex-FAANG engineers who think in software layers. AetherAI is built by someone who thinks in electrical distribution systems—distributed processing, load balancing, fault tolerance. That's not just a background difference. That's an architecture advantage.

**FUTURE TEAM (right 40%, roles to hire):**

**Next Hires (Q1 2025):**
- **CTO** - Scale infrastructure & engineering
- **Head of Sales** - Defense contractor relationships
- **Compliance Officer** - CMMC/FedRAMP expertise
- **DevOps Lead** - Production operations

**Advisory Board (Building):**
- Defense industry veteran (TBD)
- Cybersecurity expert (TBD)
- Enterprise sales leader (TBD)

**BOTTOM QUOTE (centered, italicized, teal):**
"Give me an electrician who understands resilient infrastructure over a software engineer who's never pulled permits. Every time."

**Speaker Notes:**
"Let me tell you why I'm the right person to build this. I hold both a Master Electrician license and an Electrical Contractor license from Nashville, Indiana—which means I'm legally authorized to design, permit, and deliver critical power infrastructure. For 15 years, I ran service departments and managed multimillion-dollar projects where failure wasn't an option. When I discovered LLMs seven months ago, I applied the same first-principles thinking: distributed architecture, fault tolerance, compliance at every layer. That's why AetherAI is built like a power grid, not a web app. Next quarter, I'm hiring a CTO, Head of Sales, Compliance Officer, and DevOps Lead. But the architecture—the vision—the 'why'? That comes from 15 years of building systems that literally can't fail."

**Key Changes Made:**
1. ✅ **Nashville, Indiana** (not Nashville, TN)
2. ✅ **Both licenses clearly stated** - Master Electrician AND Electrical Contractor
3. ✅ **Removed all musician/chess references** - keeping it 100% technical credibility
4. ✅ **Emphasized permit-pulling authority** - shows you had legal responsibility
5. ✅ **Connected electrical thinking directly to AI architecture** - this is your moat
6. ✅ **Kept the punchy quote** - differentiates you without sounding defensive

This version positions your background as a **competitive advantage**, not something to explain away. Defense contractors and enterprise buyers will respect "I built critical infrastructure for 15 years" way more than "I went to Stanford."
