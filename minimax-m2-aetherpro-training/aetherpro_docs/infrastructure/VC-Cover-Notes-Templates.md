## Generic Template (Customize firm name and why)

Subject: AetherAI Sovereign Compute - $8M Seed Application

[Firm Name],

I'm Cory Gibson, a licensed master electrician building America's sovereign AI infrastructure. 

June 2026 brings mandatory CMMC 2.0 for all federal contractors—$43B in AI contracts need verifiable CONUS compute or they lose the deal. I build 5 MW hyperscale data centers for $1.94M (industry standard: $8-12M) because I personally pull the wire and bend the conduit. First building under contract, December close.

[CUSTOM LINE: Why this specific firm - see examples below]

Attached: pitch deck and executive summary. Happy to demo the Trust Bar cryptographic proof system.

## Firm-Specific Custom Lines:

### DCVC
**Why DCVC:** "DCVC's thesis on compute infrastructure and defense tech is exactly why we're building this. You backed Applied Intuition and Anduril—you understand that America needs to own the stack, not rent it."

### Lux Capital
**Why Lux:** "Lux's focus on 'science fiction to science fact' resonates—we're making sovereign compute real with cryptographic proof, not compliance theater. You invested in Anduril and Epirus; you get that American infrastructure advantage matters."

### Founders Fund
**Why Founders Fund:** "Peter Thiel wrote about building things that matter. We're building hyperscale data centers in the Midwest at 20¢ on the dollar because I'm an electrician who knows what 750 kcmil copper actually costs. Atoms > bits."

### AMD Ventures
**Why AMD Ventures:** "Our first building is spec'd for MI300X upgrade path. We're building the sovereign compute layer that lets American enterprises leverage AMD silicon without cloud vendor lock-in. Hardware advantage meets infrastructure ownership."

### In-Q-Tel
**Why In-Q-Tel:** "IQT exists to accelerate adoption of commercial tech by IC/DoD. AetherAI solves the exact problem you're chartered to solve: verifiable sovereign compute for classified workloads. CMMC L2 now, IL5 roadmap."

### Shield Capital
**Why Shield Capital:** "Shield backs dual-use infrastructure for national security. We're not defense contractors trying to build commercial—we're commercial infrastructure built to defense standards. CMMC mandatory June 2026."

### General Catalyst
**Why General Catalyst:** "General Catalyst's 'responsible innovation' and infrastructure thesis aligns perfectly. We're building the compute layer that lets American enterprises run AI without sovereignty compromises. Real infrastructure, real margins."

### A16Z
**Why A16Z:** "A16Z's American Dynamism practice is about rebuilding critical infrastructure. We're making sovereign compute real—not with policy, but with physics. Own the iron, own the future."
